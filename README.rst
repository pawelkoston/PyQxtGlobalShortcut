Overview
--------

pygs provides cross-platform global hotkey / shortcuts for python using PyQt.

pygs is a wrapper for `libqxt <http://www.libqxt.org/>`_'s `QxtGlobalShortcut <http://doc.libqxt.org/tip/qxtglobalshortcut.html>`_.

My aim is to provide cross-platform support for global hotkeys (shortcuts) in python. Ideally I would like to remove the PyQt and libqxt dependency but that remains a (distant) future goal. I believe it is definitely possible and potentially quite useful though.

This fork support PyQt4 / PyQt5 on Python 2.x / 3.x.


Installation
------------

**Requirements** (sufficient not necessary)

* Python
* Qt
* SIP
* PyQt

To Install

``setup.py install``


Usage
-----

**See examples/simple.py**

``python simple.py``

| ``Ctrl+Alt+S`` - activate shortcut
| ``Ctrl+Alt+F`` - quit application

NOTE: Ctrl maps to COMMAND on macs!!!! Yeah this is crazy confusing. But it's Qt not me :)
